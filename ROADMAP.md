# Quorum Roadmap

## Planned

- [ ] **GitHub Action** — Publish `quorum-ai/quorum@v1` so users can add Quorum PR reviews with a simple workflow YAML (no CLI install needed). Includes synthesis, risk matrix, dissent summary, evidence report, and patch suggestions as collapsible PR comments.
- [ ] **quorum-ai GitHub org** — Create organization to host the action and future integrations

## Shipped

See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for release history.
