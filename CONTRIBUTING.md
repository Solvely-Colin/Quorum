## Code Style

- **TypeScript** in strict mode
- **ESM modules** — no CommonJS
- Keep it clean and readable

## Pull Requests

1. Branch from `main`
2. Use descriptive commit messages
3. One feature/fix per PR — keep it focused
4. Make sure it builds (`npm run build`)
5. Update docs if your change affects usage

## Filing Issues

- **Search first** — your issue might already exist
- **Use the templates** — they're there to help
- Be specific: steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, environment details

## Code of Conduct

Coming soon. In the meantime: be kind, be constructive, be collaborative.
